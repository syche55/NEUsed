### Test Strategy Design

Our team developed a testing documentation with specific testing rules based on app features, covering technical reviews, database review, development testing, qualification testing, and acceptance testing. We tested frontend and backend seperately initially and test the merged work together. Please see the Test Plan doc for the details. The test doc also serves as an issue tracker with test log, issue assignee and status record.

### Frontend Design

- Navbar
    * [x] About: a page that explains our mission and design of the site.
    * [x] Discover: a page for exploring items for sales.
    * [x] Sell: authenticated user may enter item description, category, price and item image url when adding a new post
- Sidebar 
    * [x] Category: a list of categories to guide users exploring items (eg: apparel, electronics, hobbies etc.)

### Backend Design

- Model
    * [x] Post{title; content; price; creator; status; mage url; category; email; date]
    * Post can be edit, delete, add.
